## Contributor Guidelines

### Submitting issues

### Test case required

**All bug reports and problem issues require a jsFiddle**.   
[Please fork this JSFiddle as a baseline](https://jsfiddle.net/NoahRodenbeek/m0fr5jsm/).

+ A test case clearly demonstrates the bug or issue.
+ It contains the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug.
+ Assets are not minified (we cannot debug .min.js files).
+ A link to your production site is **not** a reduced test case.

Providing a test case is the best way to get your issue addressed. Without a test case; your issue may be closed.
You must provide a clear and simple way to reproduce the issue with the provided fiddle.

### Pull requests

**Contributions are welcome**! That said, please *be prepared to edit* your pull request at request, and provide a jsFiddle of your fork working. Failure to do so will result in your pull request being closed.

*Please note that while FrenchDip is open source, this is still my baby, and by submitting a pull request you are authorizing me to edit or modify it in any way shape or form. You will be listed in Github as a contributor, but I have and will continue to steer the direction of this project.*
