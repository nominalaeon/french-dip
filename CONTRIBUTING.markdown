## Submitting issues

### Test case required

**All bug reports and problem issues require a jsFiddle**.   
[Please fork this JSFiddle as a baseline](https://jsfiddle.net/NoahRodenbeek/m0fr5jsm/).

+ A test case clearly demonstrates the bug or issue.
+ It contains the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug.
+ Assets are not minified (we cannot debug .min.js files).
+ A link to your production site is **not** a reduced test case.

Providing a test case is the best way to get your issue addressed. Without a test case; your issue may be closed.
You must provide a clear and simple way to reproduce the issue with the provided fiddle.
